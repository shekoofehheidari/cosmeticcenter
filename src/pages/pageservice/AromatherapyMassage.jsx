      <h2 className="custom-h2">What is Aromatherapy Massage?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Aromatherapy means “treatment using scents”. It uses a holistic approach
        to care for the body using pleasant smelling essential oils, such as
        rose, lemon, lavender or peppermint. These oils are massaged into the
        skin, inhaled directly or diffused to scent an entire room. An
        aromatherapist will take your medical history, emotional condition,
        general health and lifestyle into account before planning your course of
        treatment.
      </p>

      <h2 className="custom-h2">How Can it Help?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Massage with aromatherapy oils is a wonderfully relaxing and soothing
        experience. Depending on an individual’s needs, essential oils can be
        used to soothe, uplift, energise, relax or stimulate. Therapists are
        particularly sensitive to their clients’ need for modesty and the client
        is always covered with sheets or towels throughout the massage, which
        are removed only over the small portion of skin on which the therapist
        intends to work. Treatment can range from a back massage to a full body.
        If you need improvement in health problems from anxiety to poor sleep,
        you may want to consider aromatherapy. In this kind of treatment, you
        use extracts from plants called essential oils, by either breathing them
        through your nose or putting them on your skin. Some people put the oils
        on their skin when they get a massage or take a bath.

      <h2 className="custom-h2">What Are Essential Oils?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Essential oils are made from flower, herb, and tree parts, like bark,
        roots, peels, and petals. The cells that give a plant its fragrant smell
        are its “essence.” When an essence is extracted from a plant, it becomes
        an essential oil. It takes a lot of plant product to make essential
        oils. More than 200 pounds of lavender flowers are used to make just 1
        pound of lavender essential oil. Not all products made with plant
        essence are essential oils. True essential oils aren’t blended with
        other chemicals or fragrances. They’re made using a specific process
        that doesn’t change the chemistry of the plant. Lemon, chamomile,
        lavender, cedarwood, and bergamot are a few of the essential oils used
        regularly in aromatherapy.How Aromatherapy Works Experts think
        aromatherapy activates areas in your nose called smell receptors, which
        send messages through your nervous system to your brain. The oils may
        activate certain areas of your brain, like your limbic system, which
        plays a role in your emotions. They could also have an impact on your
        hypothalamus, which may respond to the oil by creating feel-good brain
        chemicals like serotonin. Some experts think that when you put essential
        oils on your skin, they cause a response in your skin and other parts of
        your body, like your joints.

      <h2 className="custom-h2">What Is Aromatherapy Used For?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        You shouldn’t use aromatherapy instead of your regular medical
        treatment. But for some conditions, research shows that aromatherapy can
        have health benefits. It may:
      </p>
      <ul className="custom-list">
        <li>Ease stress, anxiety, and depression</li>
        <li>Boost feelings of relaxation</li>
        <li>Improve sleep</li>
        <li>
          Help improve quality of life for people with long-term health problems
          like dementia
        </li>
        <li>
          Ease certain types of pain, including pain from kidney stones and
          osteoarthritis of the knee
        </li>
        <li>Fight bacteria when you put them on your skin</li>
        <li>

      <h2 className="custom-h2">SUGGESTED:</h2>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">Is It Safe?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Aromatherapy is generally safe. Essential oils can cause side effects,
        though. Some can irritate your eyes, skin, or mucous membranes in your
        nose. They can also cause mild allergic reactions. If you drink some
        essential oils they can hurt your kidneys or liver. It’s rare that
        people take essential oils by mouth, and you shouldn’t do it unless your
        doctor says it’s OK. If you’re new to aromatherapy, work with an
        aromatherapist or your doctor. And keep in mind that essential oils
        aren’t regulated by the FDA, which means that unlike drugs, the agency
        doesn’t check to see if they’re safe or work the way they’re supposed
        to.
      </p>
      <h3 className="custom-h3">
        Essential oils have been getting a lot of buzz recently for helping with
        everything from headaches to sleep to sore throats. But do these
        concentrated plant-based oils work?
      </h3>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Essential oils can make a positive impact on your health and well-being
        as long as you use them in a safe way.
      </p>

      <h2 className="custom-h2">What Are Essential Oils?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Essential oils are basically plant extracts. They’re made by steaming or
        pressing various parts of a plant (flowers, bark, leaves or fruit) to
        capture the compounds that produce fragrance. It can take several pounds
        of a plant to produce a single bottle of essential oil. In addition to
        creating scent, essential oils perform other functions in plants, too.
      </p>

      <h2 className="custom-h2">What Is Aromatherapy?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Aromatherapy is the practice of using essential oils for therapeutic
        benefit. Aromatherapy has been used for centuries. When inhaled, the
        scent molecules in essential oils travel from the olfactory nerves
        directly to the brain and especially impact the amygdala, the emotional
        center of the brain. Essential oils can also be absorbed by the skin. A
        massage therapist might add a drop or two of wintergreen to oil to help
        relax tight muscles during a rubdown. A skincare company may add
        lavender to bath salts to create a soothing soak.
      </p>

      <h2 className="custom-h2">What Are Essential Oils Good For?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Although people claim essential oils are natural remedies for a number
        of ailments, there’s not enough research to determine their
        effectiveness in human health. Results of lab studies are promising —
        one at Johns Hopkins found that certain essential oils could kill a type
        of Lyme bacteria better than antibiotics — but results in human clinical
        trials are mixed. Some studies indicate that there’s a benefit to using
        essential oils while others show no improvement in symptoms. Clinical
        trials have looked at whether essential oils can alleviate conditions
        such as:
      </p>
      <ul className="custom-list">
        <li>Anxiety</li>
        <li>Depression</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Insomnia</li>
        <li>Low appetite</li>
        <li>Dry mouth</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">How Can You Use Essential Oils Safely?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        The quality of essential oils on the market varies greatly, from pure
        essential oils to those diluted with less expensive ingredients. And
        because there’s no regulation, the label may not even list everything
        that’s in the bottle you’re buying. That’s why essential oils should not
        be ingested. Johns Hopkins also advises against using essential oil
        diffusers, small household appliances that create scented vapor.
        Diffusion in a public area or household with multiple members can affect
        people differently. For example, peppermint is often recommended for
        headaches. But if you use it around a child who’s less than 30 months
        old, the child can become agitated. It could have a negative effect.
        Additionally, someone with fast heartbeat can react adversely to
        peppermint. The safest ways to use essential oils include:
      </p>
      <ul className="custom-list">
        <li>
          Aromatherapy accessories: Necklaces, bracelets and keychains made with
          absorbent materials you apply essential oils to and sniff throughout
          the day.
        </li>
        <li>
          Body oil: A mixture of essential oils with a carrier oil such as
          olive, jojoba or coconut oil that can be massaged into skin. Because
          essential oils are concentrated, they can cause irritation. Avoid
          using them full-strength on skin.
        </li>
        <li>
          Aroma stick: Also called an essential oil inhaler, these portable
          plastic sticks have an absorbent wick that soaks up essential oil.
          They come with a cover to keep the scent under wraps until you’re
          ready.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">Allergic reactions to essential oils</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        A small number of people may experience irritation or allergic reactions
        to certain essential oils. You’re more likely to have a bad reaction if
        you have atopic dermatitis or a history of reactions to topical
        products. Although you can experience a reaction to any essential oil,
        some are more likely to be problematic, including:
      </p>
      <ul className="custom-list">
        <li>Oregano oil</li>
        <li>Cinnamon bark oil</li>
        <li>Jasmine oil</li>
        <li>Lemongrass oil</li>
        <li>Ylang-ylang oil</li>
        <li>Chamomile oil</li>
        <li>Bergamot oil</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Because pure essential oils are potent, diluting them in a carrier oil
        is the best way to avoid a bad reaction when applying directly to the
        skin. If you get a red, itchy rash or hives after applying essential
        oils, see a doctor. You may be having an allergic reaction.
      </p>

      <h2 className="custom-h2">Which Essential Oils Are Best?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        There are dozens of essential oils, all with different fragrances and
        chemical makeups. Which essential oils are best depends on what symptoms
        you’re looking to ease or fragrances you prefer. Some of the most
        popular essential oils include:
      </p>
      <ul className="custom-list">
        <li>
          Lavender oil: Many people find the lavender scent relaxing. It’s often
          used to help relieve stress and anxiety and promote good sleep.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tea tree oil: Also called melaleuca, this essential oil was used by
          Australia’s aboriginal people for wound healing. Today, it’s commonly
          used for acne, athlete’s foot and insect bites.
        </li>
        <li>
          Peppermint oil: There’s some evidence peppermint essential oil helps
          relieve irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms when taken in an
          enteric-coated capsule (from a trusted health supplement provider). It
          may also relieve tension headaches when applied topically.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="custom-h2">How to find quality essential oils</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        The most important thing to consider when shopping for essential oils is
        product quality. But figuring out which oils are the best is
        challenging, since there’s no government agency in the U.S. that
        provides a grading system or certification for essential oils. A big
        problem? Many companies claim their essential oils are “therapeutic
        grade,” but that’s just a marketing term. Unfortunately, there are lots
        of products you might find online or in stores that aren’t harvested
        correctly or may have something in them that isn’t listed on the label.
        Here are some tips to help you shop for pure essential oils:
      </p>
      <ul className="custom-list">
        <li>
          Look at the label: It should include the Latin name of the plant,
          information on purity or other ingredients added to it, and the
          country in which the plant was grown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Evaluate the company: Purchase products from a well-known and
          reputable aromatherapy company that’s been around for several years.
        </li>
        <li>
          Choose dark-colored, glass containers: Pure essential oils are highly
          concentrated. They can dissolve plastic bottles over time, tainting
          the oil. Most companies package essential oils in small brown or blue
          glass bottles to protect the quality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid “fragrance oils”: Fragrance or perfume oils are made from
          essential oils combined with chemicals or entirely from chemicals.
          They’re not suitable for aromatherapy — instead, look for bottles that
          contain a single essential oil in its purest form (100% essential oil
          with no other fillers).
        </li>
        <li>
          Compare prices: Essential oils range in price, depending on how
          involved harvesting and production are. Within a line, there should be
          a wide variety of prices — rose absolute or sandalwood oils will be
          more expensive, while sweet orange oil will be on the less expensive
          end. If you find a rock-bottom price for an expensive essential oil,
          it probably isn’t pure.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Essential oils can lift your mood and make you feel good with just a
        whiff of their fragrance. For some people they may even help alleviate
        the symptoms of various conditions.
