      <h2 className="custom-h2">Why Choose Cosmetic Facial Acupuncture</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Cosmetic acupuncture promotes subtle, natural looking changes to the
        skin over time. As you age, your skin’s inner layer loses collagen and,
        a result becomes less supple and firm. Acupuncture remedies the surface
        effects of ageing by triggering a self-repair response in the skin and
        addressing the internal stressors that contribute to the signs of
        ageing. This ancient beauty secret is a non-invasive and natural
        approach to reduce the signs of ageing and help skin regain its youthful
        glow as well as helping to reduce the appearance of scarring and skin
        pigmentation’s. It is the only targeted beauty treatment with direct
        health and well-being benefits. The real beauty of getting cosmetic
        acupuncture is it also includes traditional acupuncture at the same
        time, combining beauty and health. Skin tightening and face lift with
        Cosmetic Acupuncture is a natural alternative to a cosmetic face lift.
        Our applications of Cosmetic Acupuncture treatments are tailored to
        address a variety of cosmetic needs for:
      </p>
      <ul className="custom-list">
        <li>Facial rejuvenation by growing new collagen</li>
        <li>
          Face and neck lift by achieving skin tightening via collagen
          contraction
        </li>
        <li>
          Slimming and contouring, by using focused acupuncture points to
          rupture fat cells for Lipolysis and skin tightening.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">How Does it Work?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Our skin remains tight when there is a high concentration of collagen
        and elastin in the dermis layer of the skin. When the body lowers its
        production of collagen, the upper layers of skin begin to wrinkle and
        sag. To reverse this, Cosmetic Acupuncture stimulates collagen growth by
        penetrating the dermis layer. This causes a small injury to the tissue.
        However, as the tissue heals it produces new collagen that tightens the
        skin naturally. Skin tightening occurs via collagen contraction, which
        enables the face, neck, or chest to improve in appearance as new
        collagen continues to build. The treatment, as a result, reduces
        wrinkles and fine lines, it lifts and tightens areas of sagging skin,
        and rejuvenates skin to restore a more youthful appearance. Cosmetic
        acupuncture focuses on inserting fine needles to specific points and
        muscles of the face to improve the elasticity of the skin as well as
        re-sculpting the face, neck and jaw areas to decrease wrinkles and
        promote a healthier glowing appearance by activating natural collagen
        production. The treatment also works on lifting the face particularly
        where the face begins to sag around the cheek and beneath the chin
        areas. The result is revitalized and nourished skin, a brighter
        complexion and a more youthful appearance.
      </p>
      <h3 className="custom-h3">IS IT PAINFUL?</h3>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Most clients only feel minimal discomfort during the procedure.
      </p>
      <h3 className="custom-h3">HOW LONG DOES THE TREATMENT TAKE?</h3>
      <p className="custom-p">
        The size of the treatment area and the plan chosen affects the duration
        of the treatment session, which can range between 30 and 90 minutes.
      </p>
      <h3 className="custom-h3">
        ARE THERE NY SIDE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TREATMENT?
      </h3>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Clients may experience skin redness for a few days after the session.
        Some mild swelling, tingling or tenderness may occur temporarily. Less
        common effects include slight bruising and skin sensitivity. An after
        care protocol will be provided to minimise any effects.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">Top Ten Results of Cosmetic Acupuncture</h2>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">1. Helps erase years off your face</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Although each face is different, it is common that after a series of
        treatments, patients often appear 5-10 years younger. They remark that
        their others notice and most of all they are happy with the results.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">
        2. Cosmetic Acupuncture increases blood circulation to your skin
      </h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        As we age, collagen and elastin found in our skin start to cake and
        break down. Cosmetic Acupuncture stimulates production of these vital
        proteins that slow down as we age. The needles work their magic to bring
        life back to your face, neck and scalp. The increased circulation
        translates into better skin tone, fewer fine lines, and even some lift
        around sagging jowls and baggy eyes.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">3. Restore Confidence</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        It’s not about how others view us, it’s about how you feel about
        yourself! We will treat any specified gender and any age. It’s all about
        helping you glow, whatever that means to you.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">4. It’s natural and safe</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        You won’t need to worry about injectable side effects, scarring,
        pharmaceutical toxicity, surgical risks or a botched procedure.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">
        5. Cosmetic Acupuncture is good for your health
      </h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        You may as well grab the added value of gaining all the extra health
        benefits acupuncture. Your face is just a reflex zone of whatever else
        is happening in your body. We will not only work on your face in a
        cosmetic acupuncture session but the rest of your body will receive
        needles too. A full health intake will be needed to make sure you not
        only get the facial benefits, but you likely will see other nagging
        health symptoms get better such as improved sleep, improved digestion,
        less headaches and decreased PMS or menopause symptoms.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">6. Treat stubborn skin conditions</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Cosmetic Acupuncture is incredible at treating skin conditions such as
        acne, eczema and psoriasis.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">7. Long lasting effects</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        The effects of treatment can often last years. Once you complete a solid
        base of treatments (that vary from person to person but usually around
        5-10 weekly sessions) you can get away with coming in less often for
        maintenance tune-ups. We don’t want you to be a slave to any treatment.
        Our goal is that you receive enough care that you feel confident and
        comfortable enough to start spacing them out on your own terms.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">8. It’s relaxing</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Cosmetic acupuncture is relaxing! As with all our acupuncture
        treatments, the treatment stimulates the “feel good” opiates found in
        the brain. Endorphins, serotonin and cortisol have all been found to be
        produced via acupuncture; the chemicals you need to achieve mental and
        emotional well being. You will leave feeling calm, grounded and
        recharged.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">9. Cosmetic acupuncture is cheap</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Acupuncture Center Toronto offers cosmetic acupuncture with rates that
        are affordable in comparison to many other invasive and surgical
        cosmetic procedures. Value is as important to us as it is to you. You
        will save hundreds to thousands of dollars compared to injectable
        procedures or surgery. With the average cost of treating one area with
        Botox being upwards of $300/session, we can provide amazing line
        diminishing results for around half the cost.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">10. No lost time</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        No surgical recovery, no time in hiding in bandages, and no risk of
        feeling terrible afterwards. Get off the the table and immediately look
        and feel radiant.

        Cosmetic Acupuncture Frequently Asked Questions
      </h2>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">Does it hurt?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Although acupuncture should never be painful, there are more needles
        involved with cosmetic acupuncture. If you are scared/nervous of needles
        the treatment probably isn’t the best choice for you. Although it’s not
        painful, the needles can sometimes feel pinching and uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">Are there side effects?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Because cosmetic acupuncture involves an increased volume of applied
        needles and facial cupping applies suction, there is not-so-often
        bruising. Although it is uncommon, it does happen on a very rare
        occasion.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">How many sessions do I need?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Although everyone’s face responds to treatment at a different pace, we
        aim for you to see results after your first appointment. Reaching your
        aesthetic goals will usually require a series of approximately 10
        sessions. Having said that, we work with patients on setting up a
        treatment frequency and pace that they can manage. Some patients see
        through a series of treatments while others find that they find benefit
        from once in while “tune-ups”. Although we will recommend a treatment
        frequency protocol that is ideal, no pressure, do what works best for
        your schedule and budget.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">
        Is Cosmetic Acupuncture Covered by Insurance?
      </h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        All Cosmetic Appointments are subject to HST. As a result, receipts will
        itemize the- “HST”, “Acupuncture” and “Cosmetic Acupuncture” portions of
        each appointment. It is your responsibility to check the details of your
        benefit package prior to booking as insurance plans widely vary from
        organization to organization. We cannot customize or “tweak” receipts
        based on individual benefit plans. Feel free to reach out if you have
        any questions. Can I get cosmetic acupuncture if I’ve had Botox,
        injectables or other cosmetic procedures? No. You will need to hold off
        for 8 weeks before we can begin. Cosmetic Acupuncture/facial cupping can
        interfere with other recent procedures.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">
        Can I get Cosmetic Acupuncture if I’m pregnant?
      </h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        No. For safety reasons, we cannot provide Cosmetic Acupuncture to
        pregnant folks. Cosmetic Acupuncture requires more needles than is safe
        to administer during pregnancy. The goal is to direct as much blood and
        circulation towards the uterus and not the face. Come chill with us
        after you’ve given birth and we’ll get your glow on then!
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">How should I prepare for my treatment?</h2>
      <h3>Remove make-up</h3>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Please ensure that all make-up is removed. We need to work with a “clean
        slate” face in order to make swabbing and disinfection accessible and
        also making sure we have a clear view without make-up getting in the way
        of the therapists work. Feel free to a few minutes early to remove
        make-up and reapply after your session in the washroom.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3>Bring shorts</h3>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Please bring a pair of shorts as we will be needling points on the body.

      <h2 className="custom-h2">
        Why should I try Cosmetic Acupuncture over other conventional methods?
      </h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        This Ancient Chinese beauty secret now becoming a popular alternative to
        plastic surgery, Botox injections and pharmaceuticals. Our facial
        rejuvenation acupuncture involves bringing fresh oxygenated blood to the
        face. It has been proven to stimulate collagen production. Collagen is a
        protein found in skin cells which stops being produced as we age. A lack
        of collagen is responsible for wrinkles, fine lines and loss of skin
        elasticity. The treatment slows down the aging process from within and
        is well suited for both female and male patients. Bring out your inner
        radiance without the pharmaceutical side effects or nerve damage of
        conventional methods.
