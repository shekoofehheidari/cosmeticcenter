        <h2 className="custom-h2">What Is a Facial?</h2>
        <p className="custom-p">
          People get facials for different reasons: some want to remove
          blackheads, others seek anti-aging help, and many just want to relax.
          A facial is a multi-step skin treatment that includes cleansing,
          exfoliation, and nourishment, promoting a clear, well-hydrated
          complexion. It's most effective when part of a consistent skincare
          regimen.

        <h2 className="custom-h2">The Basic Steps of a Facial</h2>

        <h3 className="custom-h3">Consultation</h3>
        <p className="custom-p">
          A facial begins with a consultation to understand your skin concerns,
          medications, and skincare routine. This helps the esthetician choose
          the right products and treatment.
        </p>

        <h3 className="custom-h3">Preparations</h3>
        <p className="custom-p">
          You'll change into a wrap provided by the esthetician for comfort and
          modesty. The spa's protocol varies, so follow their instructions.
        </p>

        <h3 className="custom-h3">Cleansing</h3>
        <p className="custom-p">
          The esthetician wraps your hair and performs a double cleanse to
          remove dirt, oil, and makeup.
        </p>

        <h3 className="custom-h3">Skin Analysis</h3>
        <p className="custom-p">
          The esthetician examines your skin using a magnifying lamp to
          determine type and condition before proceeding with customized
          treatment.
        </p>

        <h3 className="custom-h3">Steam</h3>
        <p className="custom-p">
          A warm vapor opens pores and softens blackheads and whiteheads for
          extraction. Sensitive skin types may skip this step.
        </p>

        <h3 className="custom-h3">Exfoliation</h3>
        <p className="custom-p">
          Removes dead skin using mechanical scrubs or chemical enzymes.
          Chemical exfoliants can be stronger and may require separate
          treatments.
        </p>

        <h3 className="custom-h3">Extractions</h3>
        <p className="custom-p">
          Manual removal of blackheads or whiteheads. Can be uncomfortable and
          should be done carefully to avoid damage.
        </p>

        <h3 className="custom-h3">Facial Massage</h3>
        <p className="custom-p">
          Uses classic strokes to relax and stimulate skin and muscles.
        </p>

        <h3 className="custom-h3">Facial Mask</h3>
        <p className="custom-p">
          Applied according to skin type and condition. Often followed by scalp
          massage or similar service.
        </p>

        <h3 className="custom-h3">Final Application</h3>
        <p className="custom-p">
          Ends with application of toner, serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen (if
          daytime).
