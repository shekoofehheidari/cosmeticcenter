      <h1 className="custom-h1">PRP </h1>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">What Is PRP? </h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Platelet-rich plasma, or PRP, is a substance that’s thought to promote
        healing when injected. Plasma is a component of your blood that contains
        special “factors,” or proteins, that help your blood to clot. It also
        contains proteins that support cell growth. Researchers have produced
        PRP by isolating plasma from blood and concentrating it.
      </p>
      <img src={prpimg2} className="centered-image w-2/6" />
      <p className="custom-p">
        The idea is that injecting PRP into damaged tissues will stimulate your
        body to grow new, healthy cells and promote healing. Because the tissue
        growth factors are more concentrated in the prepared growth injections,
        researchers think the body’s tissues may heal faster. <br />
        The treatment hasn’t been definitively proven. However, famous athletes
        like Tiger Woods and tennis star Rafael Nadal have been known to use
        these injections to help heal injuries.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">What are the purposes of PRP injections? </h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Researchers are trying out PRP injections across a number of
        applications. Examples of these include: <br />
        <strong>Hair loss:</strong> Doctors have injected PRP into the scalp to
        promote hair growth and prevent hair loss. According to research from
        2014, PRP injections are effective in treating androgenic alopecia,
        which is also known as male pattern baldness. <br />
        <strong>Tendon injuries:</strong> Tendons are tough, thick bands of
        tissue that connect muscle to bone. They are usually slow to heal after
        injury. Doctors have used PRP injections to treat chronic tendon
        problems, such as tennis elbow, Achilles tendonitis at the ankle, and
        jumper’s knee, or pain in the patellar tendon in the knee.
      </p>
      <img src={prpimg3} className="centered-image w-2/6" />

      <p className="custom-p">
        <strong>Acute injuries: </strong> Doctors have used PRP injections to
        treat acute sports injuries, such as pulled hamstring muscles or knee
        sprains. <br />
        <strong>Postsurgical repair:</strong> Sometimes doctors use PRP
        injections after surgery to repair a torn tendon (such as a rotator cuff
        tendon in the shoulder) or ligaments (such as the anterior cruciate
        ligament, or ACL).
      </p>
      <img src={prpimg4} className="centered-image w-2/6" />

      <p className="custom-p">
        <strong>Osteoarthritis </strong> Doctors have injected PRP into the
        knees of people with osteoarthritis. A 2015 study found that PRP
        injections were more effective than hyaluronic acid injections (a
        traditional therapy) for treating osteoarthritis. However, the trial was
        a small group of 160 people, so larger trials are needed for this to be
        conclusive. <br />
        It’s important to note that none of these uses have been definitively
        proven to provide results.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2"> PRP injection process</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Here’s what to expect from a typical PRP injection process:
      </p>
      <ul className="custom-list">
        <li>
          A healthcare professional will draw a sample of your blood. The amount
          of the sample depends on where the PRP will be injected. For example,
          the amount of blood taken for injection into the scalp for one study
          was 20 milliliters. This is slightly larger than one teaspoon.
        </li>
        <li>
          The blood is placed into a centrifuge. This is a machine that spins
          around very quickly, causing the blood components to separate. The
          separation process takes about 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          A technologist takes the separated plasma and prepares it for
          injection into the affected area.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="custom-p">This process usually takes around one hour. </p>

      <h2 className="custom-h2">What are the potential side effects of PRP?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Because PRP involves injecting a substance into the skin, there are
        potential side effects. PRP is autologous, which means it contains
        substances that come directly from your own body. This reduces the risks
        for an allergic reaction that can occur from injecting other
        medications, such as cortisone or hyaluronic acid. However, there are
        risks from the injection itself, including:{" "}
      </p>
      <ul className="custom-list">
        <li>infection</li>
        <li>nerve injuries</li>
        <li>pain at the injection site</li>
        <li>tissue damage</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="custom-p">
        You should discuss these potential risks with your doctor, as well as
        the steps your doctor will take to minimize these risks.
      </p>

      <h2 className="custom-h2">
        What is the recovery time for PRP injections?
      </h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        When PRP is injected following injury, your doctor may recommend that
        you rest the affected area. However, these recommendations are more
        related to the injury and less to the PRP injections. Most people can
        continue their daily activities following PRP injections. <br />
        Because PRP injections are intended to promote healing or growth, you
        may not notice an immediate difference after receiving the injections.
        However, in several weeks or months, you may observe that the area is
        healing faster or growing more hair than you would have expected if you
        hadn’t received PRP injections.
