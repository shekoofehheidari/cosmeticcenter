      <p>
        Cupping has become a hot topic in recent years with news of models,
        movie stars and Olympic athletes using cups to ease aches and pains and
        enhance health and well-being. But cupping isn’t just for
        celebrities.“Instead of using medication to achieve a certain outcome,
        we use cupping to help trigger the body’s own healing mechanisms.”

      <h2 className="custom-h2">FAQ: Cupping</h2>
      <p>
        Cupping is a form of therapy that originated in China more than 2,000
        years ago. It has been used in the West for decades to encourage
        healing. We asked Lehmann to answer commonly asked questions about this
        seemingly mystical therapy:

      <h3 className="custom-h3">Q: What is cupping?</h3>
      <p>
        A: Cupping is almost like a deep tissue massage with suction and
        decompression. Chinese medical practitioners believe cupping helps keep
        the body in balance, increases overall blood flow and reduces pain. Some
        athletes use this type of therapy to decrease muscle recovery time. It
        is often used in conjunction with acupuncture or acupressure.
      </p>

      <h3 className="custom-h3">Q: How does cupping work?</h3>
      <p>
        A: Cupping uses a cup to pull an area of skin into a suction that
        decompresses muscles and connective tissue. This promotes blood flow to
        the compromised area, enhances circulation and helps to increase the
        body’s own healing processes — almost like a backward deep tissue
        massage. There are several different types of cups ranging from glass to
        silicone and bamboo, and there are different ways to use them. Sometimes
        practitioners will only use one or two cups. Other times, they’ll cover
        your entire back with cups. Two popular types of cupping: stationary and
        sliding. Stationary cupping uses suction only, keeping the cups in place
        for a set time, usually 5 to 10 minutes. Sliding cupping is more like a
        deep tissue massage where the provider moves the cups over the area of
        pain or concern.

        Q: What can I expect during and after a cupping session?
      </h3>
      <p>
        A: Some people love the sensation. Others hate it. In most cases, you
        will notice some bruising around the treated area. Bruises may be pink,
        red or sometimes purple or dark brown. Bruising typically goes away
        within two weeks. You may also notice changes on the surface of the
        skin. It’s important to take care of yourself after a treatment. Stay
        warm, cover up, drink plenty of water and eat wholesome foods. You
        should also avoid swimming or showering within three hours of a cupping
        session.
      </p>

      <h3 className="custom-h3">Q: Which conditions respond to cupping?</h3>
      <p>
        A: Practitioners use cupping to treat a wide variety of conditions. They
        think it’s especially effective at treating pain and muscle aches.
        Applying cups to specific acupressure points may also help alleviate
        digestive complaints, skin issues and respiratory problems.
      </p>

      <h3 className="custom-h3">Q: What are the side effects?</h3>
      <p>
        A: Side effects are typically mild and include bruising and irritation
        of the treated areas. In rare cases, you may feel lightheaded or
        nauseous shortly after your session.
      </p>

      <h3 className="custom-h3">
        Q: Is there anyone who should NOT get cupping?
      </h3>
      <p>
        A: There are a few conditions and situations where cupping is not
        appropriate. If you’re on high doses of blood thinners, or if you are
        thin, frail or have fragile skin, cupping is not appropriate. Similarly,
        if you have active cancer, skin trauma or a blood disorder, you should
        stay away from it until your circumstances change. In any case, always
        share your medication list and health history with your practitioner
        before a session.

        “Unfortunately, there’s no certifying body for cupping,” says Lehmann.
        “If you’re working with an acupuncturist to treat an imbalance and you
        feel like you’re not getting better, you might ask if cupping can help.”

        Sometimes our bodies need support. Since cupping may help reduce
        inflammation and enhances circulation, it could be just what your body
        needs to get back on a path toward wellness. As with any therapy, talk
        to your doctor before doing a session to ensure it’s appropriate for
        you.
