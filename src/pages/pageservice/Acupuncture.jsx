        Acupuncture is a time-tested healing practice that involves inserting
        thin, sterile stainless steel needles into specific points on the body.
        These points, located along meridians (energy pathways), help promote
        circulation, relax muscles, improve neurological function, and provide
        pain relief. Rooted in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and
        Contemporary Medical Acupuncture (CMA), acupuncture has been practiced
        for thousands of years and continues to be a trusted method for holistic
        healing and wellness.

        What to Expect During an Acupuncture Session
      </h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Your session begins with a consultation to discuss your health concerns.

        may enhance the treatment with:
