      <p className="custom-p">
        Calcium peels are exfoliation treatments which smooth out upper layers
        of the skin with the use a acid. Calcium peels are great options for
        pigmentation as it exfoliates the top surface of the skin where
        superficial scarring lies. <br />
        Calcium peels are also popular for mature skins who want to regenerate
        the skin on a deeper level than what is typically achieved with
        microdermabrasion treatment or Calcium peels. By stimulating cutaneous
        shedding, we are able to exfoliate the superficial layers of the skin
        which improves pigmentation and scarring. Calcium peels are safe for all
        skin types.

      <h3 className="custom-h3">What Are Post Peel Instructions?</h3>
      <p className="custopm-p">
        After receiving a Calcium peel, avoid sun exposure as much as possible
        when healing. Do not pick or peel the skin as these actions can cause
        scarring. Avoid excessive exercise for 24-48 hours post treatment as
        well.

      <h3 className="custom-h3">How Many Treatments Will I Need?</h3>
      <p className="custopm-p">
        The number of treatments varies from individual to individual depending
        on the condition treated and purpose for treatment. For corrective
        procedures, 6 treatments are typical spaced approximately 2-4 weeks
        apart. For maintenance programs, sensitive skins/Rosacea sufferers, or

        depending on the intensity of the peel.

      <h3 className="custom-h3">What Are Alphahydroxy Acids?</h3>
      <p className="custopm-p">
        Alphahydroxy acids are water soluble acids which have been used for
        years for skin rejuvenation. These are naturally occurring acids found
        in fruits and other foods. They are used in many concentrations,
        however, commonly used to formulate the lightest of peels. These types
        of peels can provide smoother, brighter-looking skin. AHA peels may be
        used to treat fine lines, areas of dryness, uneven pigmentation and
        acne.
      </p>
      <h3 className="custom-h3">What Degree Of Peeling Should I Expect?</h3>
      <p className="custopm-p">
        The degree of peeling depends on the strength/depth of the peel and your
        particular skin condition we are treating. Some clients will get a fair
        amount of flaking while others do not have any at all. This does not
        mean the peel did not work. We are slowly breaking down the skinâ€™s top
        layer which may take a few sessions to penetrate deeply. This means the
        product has penetrated and exfoliated the skin at a microscopic level.
        In general, whether you have experienced heavy peeling or not the end
        results is a glowing and smooth skin complexion.
