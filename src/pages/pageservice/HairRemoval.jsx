          hair removal system available today.

        <h1 className="custom-h2">
          How is Soprano ICE different from other Soprano hair removal systems?{" "}
        </h1>
        <p className="custom-p">
          Soprano ICE is an advanced hair removal platform that incorporates
          multiple laser wavelengths and technologies. It offers power and
          versatility that allows you to treat the widest range of patients and
          hair types all year round.
        </p>

        <h1 className="custom-h2">
          Is hair removal with Soprano ICE really painless?
        </h1>
        <p className="custom-p">
          Soprano ICE uses Alma Laser’s SHR method, which is the only clinically
          proven method of laser hair removal that is virtually painless. The
          unique heating and energy delivery method effectively damages the hair
          follicle while preventing injury and pain to the surrounding tissue.
          At the same time, integrated ICETM tech cools the skin surface,
          preventing superficial burns and the sensation of pain.
        </p>

        <h1 className="custom-h2">Is hair removal with Soprano ICE safe?</h1>
        <p className="custom-p">
          Absolutely. Soprano ICE’s SHR method has been proven in multiple
          clinical studies as the safest method of laser hair removal for all
          skin types. With SHR, hair follicles are damaged not by a single pulse
          of high energy which can injure the skin, but by repetitive short
          energy pulses. These pulses produce heat build-up which gradually
          raises the temperature of the dermis to the level needed for
          preventing hair growth, while minimizing the risk of burns.
        </p>

        <h1 className="custom-h2">
          Is hair removal with Soprano ICE safe for dark skin?
        </h1>
        <p className="custom-p">
          Yes. While the melanin in dark skin is exponentially more sensitive to
          the heat used in laser treatment, Soprano ICE’s SHR method has been
          clinically proven to be the safe for dark skin types. Rather than
          exposing the hair follicle to a single high energy pulse which can
          cause trauma to skin with a high melanin count, SHR gradually heats
          the skin until the required heat energy is delivered to the hair
          follicle. This makes SHR the safest laser hair removal option,
          including for dark skinned patients.
        </p>

        <h1 className="custom-h2">
          Can Soprano ICE be used in the summer and can it treat tanned skin?
        </h1>
        <p className="custom-p">
          Yes. Soprano ICE’s SHR method affects the melanin of the skin using a
          unique method, allowing the procedure to be performed anytime of the
          year as well as on tanned skin. Furthermore, sun exposure is less
          traumatic to the skin following SHR treatment.
        </p>

        <h1 className="custom-h2">
          Are Soprano ICE treatments performed only by physicians or can they be
          performed by clinical staff?
        </h1>
        <p className="custom-p">
          Treatments with Soprano ICE are easily delegated to clinical staff.
          The Soprano ICE system is simple to operate featuring a user-friendly
          interface. Treatments are clean and quick with no disposables.
        </p>

        <h1 className="custom-h2">
          How long are treatment sessions with Soprano ICE?
        </h1>
        <p className="custom-p">
          While Soprano ICE offers the fastest laser hair removal solution
          available today, the duration of treatment can vary depending on the
          patient’s skin color, hair type and the area being treated. Treatment
          time can range from a few seconds for a small area such as above the
          upper lip, to 8 minutes for the entire back.
        </p>

        <h1 className="custom-h2">How does laser hair removal work?</h1>
        <p className="custom-p">
          Soprano Ice is the most trusted name in the industry for laser
          treatment devices, and we feel it is the Gold standard for hair
          removal. The science Soprano Ice allows for optimal treatment at a
          lower fluence (or energy). This advancement provides hair removal
          efficacy like that of our other Alma laser treatments, but with higher
          comfort levels during treatment. The laser system delivers a beam of
          highly focused light which hair pigment absorbs and converts to heat.
          This process causes thermal damage to the hair follicle to stop it
          from growing again. Because your hair grows in three phases, laser
          hair removal for men is more effective when the hairs are in their
          active growth cycle. Not all your hairs are in this phase at the same
          time. Therefore, multiple treatments are performed to achieve hair
          removal. After soprano ice laser hair removal, the hair will shed over
          14 weeks, resulting in a hair-free period of up to six weeks. Then you
          can schedule additional treatments for the next cycle. Laser hair
          removal generally works best for areas where the hair is dark and/or
          coarse. The number of laser hair removal treatments varies based on
          ones ethnic background or skin type as well as the area treated. All
          areas of the body are treatable so long as your hair is darker than
          your skin tone. The only exception are eyebrows, as they are too close
          to the eyes for you to receive safe treatment. Tattooed areas also
          cannot receive treatment. Grey, white hair is untreatable
        </p>

        <h1 className="custom-h2">Does laser hair removal for men hurt?</h1>
        <p className="custom-p">
          Most men tolerate the treatment just fine. Our Alma laser system is
          not only quick, but it also reduces the discomfort with its method of
          laser hair removal. We will be very sensitive to your comfort level,
          and take any appropriate measures to ensure a painless procedure.
        </p>

        <h1 className="custom-h2">How Many Sessions Do I Need?</h1>
        <p className="custom-p">
          All areas require a minimum of 6 sessions to start. Sessions are
          generally 4 to 5 weeks apart depending on the area to be treated.
          Hormonal areas will need additional sessions. How many sessions you
          require will depend on the amount of hair, hair color, your genetic
          background and how closely you follow the schedule set by your
          technician. For complete removal, you will most likely need more than
          6 sessions.
        </p>

        <h1 className="custom-h2">Why Are My Results Different From Others?</h1>
        <p className="custom-p">
          Results and the number of sessions you need depend on the contrast of
          your skin and hair color, your ethnic background and your hormones.
        </p>

        <h1 className="custom-h2">What Does Laser Hair Removal Feel Like?</h1>
        <p className="custom-p">
          Laser hair removal can cause mild to moderate discomfort. Treatment
          feels like a rubber band snapping against the skin, followed by a
          cooling sensation. You may feel like you have a light sunburn for 1 to
          2 hours after treatment. For our most sensitive clients we offer
          numbing cream by the application or by the tube.
        </p>

        <h1 className="custom-h2">Pre Treatment Precautions</h1>
        <ul className="custom-list">
          <li className="custom-p">
            It is important that the area being treated not be exposed to the
            sun. A broad- spectrum (UVA/UVB) sunscreen of 30 SPF or higher
            should be applied whenever area to be treated is exposed to the sun.
            This practice should continue between treatments and following your
            last treatment for at least 6 weeks. Hyper pigmentation, or
            hypo-pigmentation can result if treated area is exposed to the sun
            without sunscreen.
          </li>
          <li className="custom-p">
            DO NOT use Retina or Renovo one week prior to laser treatment.
          </li>
          <li className="custom-p">
            DO NOT take Acutance for six months prior to laser treatment.
          </li>
          <li className="custom-p">
            DO NOT pluck, tweeze, thread, wax or use depilatory agents for three
            weeks prior to treatment.
          </li>
          <li className="custom-p">
            The area should be shaved 24-48 hours prior to treatment. Stubble is
            needed to visualize area. If the area being treated has a heavy hair
            growth, you should shave just prior to coming for treatment.
          </li>
          <li className="custom-p">
            DO NOT wear make-up, deodorant, perfumes or powder on the areas to
            be treated.
          </li>
          <li className="custom-p">
            Plan to avoid tight elastic at the leg opening, following bikini
            treatments, for 3-5 days.{" "}
          </li>
          <li className="custom-p">
            If you have a history of oral herpes (fever blisters) and are having
            your mouth area treated, you will need to have your physician
            prescribe suppressive therapy and take as directed.
          </li>
          <li className="custom-p">
            We will not perform your laser treatment if you have a suntan,
            sunburn, or have used self-tanning cream because of the likelihood
            of hyper-pigmentation or hypo-pigmentation.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="custom-p">
          Remember To achieve the desired results; the specified number of
          treatments must be adhered to. Skipping treatments, even when it
          appears you have achieved the results, will result in a less that
          adequate outcome. To reduce your risk of complications, it is
          important to follow these post treatment instructions. If you have any
          questions or concerns, please contact your laser technician.{" "}
