        How TriPollar Works TriPollar technology, utilizing painless, focused
        and optimal radio-frequency (RF) energy to the dermis and to
        subcutaneous fat layers While treating the body. Controlled energy is
        delivered via three or more electrodes, and is limited to the treatment
        area. This focused delivery results in immediate visible results. <br />
        For improved results it is recommended to undergo a course of
        treatments. Superior 3rd Generation Technology TriPollar® RF is
        clinically and histopathologically proven to simultaneously and
        homogenously heat both superficial (dermal) and deep (hypodermal) layers
        While treating the body.
        <br />
        Both 1st generation Mono-Polar and 2nd generation Bi-Polar RF
        technologies are non-focused, and, therefore typically require much
        higher energy to achieve results, attained by heating of the skin.
        Notably, this may cause pain and poses a higher risk of burns and damage
        to the skin. In addition, these technologies may require cooling
        mechanisms to mitigate risks, which result in less efficient heating of
        the skin layers. <br />
        By contrast, TriPollar 3rd generation RF technology has a unique
        configuration of sophisticated control algorithms that causes the tissue
        to heat from within while keeping the epidermis safe. <br />
        The focused Tripollar RF− due to its high density− enables the use of
        low energy, thereby providing immediate and long lasting results. Due to
        the relatively low power needed to perform Tripollar treatments, these
        procedures are painless and pleasant. <br />
        Treat Delicate Areas TriPollar technology enables treatment of fine
        lines and very delicate areas of the face without causing damage or
        pain. These include areas around the lips (perioral) and around the eyes
        (periorbital). Collagen Regeneration Collagen and elastin are produced
        by fibroblasts. As they are heated, they contract and are pulled
        together, resulting in immediate skin tightening. <br />
        The deep heating accelerates the conformational changes of the collagen
        and the elastin, resulting in tighter and smoother skin. In addition,
        the thermal effect triggers the fibroblasts to increase the production
        of new collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid which in turn augment the
        newly achieved younger skin appearance. <br />

      <p className="custom-p">
        The geneO+ oxygeneo machine redefines facial treatments by integrating
        the 3 most effective skin-enhancing technologies available on the
        market, for the ultimate Super Facial: OxyGeneo, Ultrasound & TriPollar
        RF − an all-in-one skin renewal treatment. A single platform can now
        deliver skin nourishment and skin tightening, while also reducing the
        appearance of wrinkles. The geneO+ Super Facial platform uses Ultrasound
        to increase skin permeability for maximal infusion of essential
        nutrients, and TriPollar RF for skin tightening, firming and
        rejuvenation.

      <h2 className="custom-h2"> TriPollar® Skin Tightening Hand Piece</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        The OxyGeneo is now available with TriPollar® technology, the 3rd and
        latest generation and MOST advanced radio frequency (RF) <br />
        technology in the industry, offering skin tightening!
        <br />
        The TriPollar® hand piece : painless, non-invasive skin tightening for
        the face and neck. <br />
        Benefit and results include face lifting, smoothing the jaw line,
        sagging skin, treating wrinkles and fine lines, and smoothing the skin
        on the neck. TriPollar® treatments give the skin a fresh, tight,
        rejuvenated appearance. <br />
        How it works: TriPollar® delivers focused RF energy to the skin surface
        and subcutaneous layers. The energy heats the skin’s fibroblast which
        causes the collagen fibers to contract inducing immediate skin
        tightening. TriPollar® RF energy also stimulates natural collagen
        regeneration resulting in substantial improvement in the appearance of
        wrinkles. Never before has a facial treatment offered such instant,
        effective results in a pleasant and relaxing way… until the OxyGeneo
        with the TriPollar® hand piece. <br />
        The TriPollar® Preparation Gel is uniquely formulated to prepare the
        skin for the transfer of TriPollar® energy and is used for maximum
        effectiveness and best results.
