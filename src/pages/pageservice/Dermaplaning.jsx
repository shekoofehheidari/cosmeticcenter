      <h2 className="custom-h2">What Is Dermaplaning?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Dermaplaning is a procedure for exfoliating the outer most layer of skin
        and ridding it of fine hair we tend to call peach fuzz. It’s a quick
        service that’s generally performed on the face. A trained and medically
        supervised Esthetician uses a scalpel and a soft touch, scraping the
        surface of the skin using light feathery strokes.
      </p>

      <h2 className="custom-h2">Why Get It?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Dermaplaning not only gets rid of peach fuzz on the face, it also
        exfoliates removing dead skin cells on the outermost layer.
      </p>

      <p className="custom-p">
        It’s a great option for those who want a deep exfoliation, but are not
        allowed to use peeling agents on their skin because of adverse
        reactions. This might be because of a medical condition or being
        pregnant or nursing.
      </p>

      <h2 className="custom-h2">How It Compares to Traditional Shaving ?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        So if dermaplaning just seems like a very fancy and expensive way to
        shave, then you’re almost right. The real difference is the level of
        exfoliation. The technician can determine how deep to plane the skin,
        where a razor can only go so far. Shaving can be done every day whereas
        dermaplaning should most definitely not. You actually need to wait two
        weeks before the next session. Although sunscreen is important for
        everyone, it’s very crucial after getting this service because the skin
        is very sensitive to the sun and hyperpigmentation (dark skin spots) are
        possible. Shaving can be scary for some because there is a myth that the
        hair will grow back thicker and darker. This is not the case. The reason
        it can look thicker and darker is because the razor will cause a blunt
        edge. The blunt edge is what may cause the hair to look and feel
        thicker.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">Why Don’t I Know About This?</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Dermaplaning isn’t usually offered at most spas and clinic. Some
        doctor’s offices and medispas will provide this service. Generally,
        Estheticians don’t even know about it because it may be beyond the scope
        of practice in their state, and they use microdermabrasion or chemical
        peels to provide deep exfoliation treatments. Most doctors’ offices or
        medispas that have it on the menu will offer it with a chemical peel or
        facial because it allows the other products to sink deeper into the skin
        with the aim of quicker or better results.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">Consider This</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        I bet you’re telling yourself you will just shave them and remove that
        peach fuzz and get a good exfoliation. We don’t recommend women shaving
        their face unless it’s an emergency situation or you’re going through
        laser hair removal or electrolysis where it’s one of your only hair
        removal options. If you’re going to use a razor on your face for
        whatever reason, follow the rules of shaving like you do with other
        parts of your body. First, make sure your face is clean. Otherwise, you
        can allow bacteria into the small cuts and that may cause an infection.
        Never use a dull razor blade. Always apply shaving cream or gel to damp
        skin prior to shaving, even if there’s just peach fuzz. Shaving with a
        dry manual razor can cause razor burn or a rash, which always doesn’t
        show up immediately. Shaving also does exfoliate the skin but not as
        deep as dermaplaning. However, both can cause damage to the skin,
        leaving scarring or infections. Removing hair has been a beauty secret
        for centuries. Remember when making your choice always go forth with
        caution and make sure safety is at the top of your list. Keep in mind
        that many ways of removing hair also exfoliate the skin, some more than
        others. So with your hairless skin, remember sunscreen can be your best
        friend.

      <h2 className="custom-h2">benefits of dermaplaning:</h2>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">Removes Facial Hair</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        A dermaplane facial has a similar function to the “shaving your face”
        fad. But it is much more effective because of the type of blade used.
        This one is much sharper than what you can typically purchase in stores,
        and by having a professional aesthetician take care of those problem
        areas you are much more likely to experience a better result.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">Exfoliates Skin</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        While many people first consider getting a dermaplane facial as a
        pain-free method to hair removal, the dermaplane facial hosts many other
        benefits. And one of these is its ability to remove dead skin cells from
        the face. Unlike with microdermabrasion and other exfoliation
        techniques, dermaplaning does not require any special chemicals and is
        non-abrasive. This makes it great for those with sensitive skin while
        leaving the skin looking naturally flawless and feeling smooth to the
        touch.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">Anti-Aging Properties</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        First let’s debunk what exactly anti-aging is. In no way does anti-aging
        products and treatments reverse aging of the skin. What it does do is
        prevent any further damage, and help reduce the appearance of the
        effects damage has already done to the skin. This makes your skin look
        fresher and younger. With a dermaplane facial, you essentially shave off
        that entire top layer of dead skin, reducing the effects of fine lines,
        hyperpigmentation and acne scars. This makes the skin look more awake
        and revitalized, which gives you that younger appearance.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">Painless</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Many hair removal treatments as you probably already know are filled
        with frustration and pain. Whether you normally get your facial hair
        waxed or tweezed, or if you’ve considered getting it removed with
        lasers, the pain of hair removal is unnecessary. While a dermaplane
        facial may seem the scariest, it is actually the most harmless. It
        provides for a completely painless and surprisingly relaxing experience.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">No Down Time</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        With many other treatments, your face may be beet red after, you fear
        leaving the house and you may be required to do some at-home
        maintenance. With a dermaplane facial, all you need to do is come in for
        your treatment and use a gentle facial cleanser that night.
      </p>
      <h2 className="custom-h2">Makeup Goes on Smoothly</h2>
      <p className="custom-p">
        And from all these wonderful benefits comes how amazing your skin will
        look as well as how beautiful your makeup will look. Once you get a
        dermaplane facial, your makeup will easily glide over your now smooth
        and movie star quality skin.
