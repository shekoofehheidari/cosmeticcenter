        Chemical peels can improve the skin’s appearance. In this treatment, a
        chemical solution is applied to the skin, which makes it “blister” and
        eventually peel off. The new skin is usually smoother and less wrinkled
        than the old skin.

        <span className="font-bold">After a chemical peel,</span> skin is
        temporarily more sensitive to the sun, so wear sunscreen every day. It
        should say “broad-spectrum” on the label, meaning it protects against
        the sun’s UVA and UVB rays. Also, it should be a physical sunscreen and
        be above SPF 30. Limit your time in the sun, especially between the
        hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., and wear a wide-brimmed hat.

        Who Is a Good Candidate For a Chemical Peel?
      </h3>
      <p className="custom-p">
        Generally, fair-skinned and light-haired patients are better candidates
        for chemical peels. If you have darker skin, you may also have good
        results, depending upon the type of problem being treated. But you also
        may be more likely to have an uneven skin tone after the procedure.Skin
        sags, bulges, and more severe wrinkles do not respond well to chemical
        peels. They may need other kinds of cosmetic surgical procedures, such
        as laser resurfacing, a facelift, brow lift, eyelid lift, or soft tissue
        filler (collagen or fat). A dermatologic surgeon can help determine the
        most appropriate type of treatment for you.
